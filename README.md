# Recently-Updated-Logger
Source code to my recently updated logger.
Do not mind my old and ugly code, I rewrote some functions for better optimization.

If you want to blacklist a certain creator's models from logging, put their username in the empty array in "Blacklisted.json".


Updated:

Tired of fat, chubby, lumpy asset spammers? I don't really care but I added asset spam detection and automatically blacklists the creator.
